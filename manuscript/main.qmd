Accurately reconstructing large-scale palaeoclimate patterns from sparse local records is critical for understanding the evolution of Earth's climate. Particular challenges arise from the patchiness, uneven spatial distribution, and disparate nature of palaeoclimatic proxy records. Geochemical data typically provide temperature estimates via transfer functions derived from experiments. Similarly, transfer functions based on the climatic requirements of modern taxa exist for some fossil groups, such as pollen assemblages. In contrast, most ecological and lithological data (e.g. coral reefs and evaporites) only convey information on broad climatic requirements. Historically, most large-scale proxy-based reconstructions have used either geochemical or ecological data, but few studies have combined multiple proxy types into a single quantitative reconstruction. Large spatial gaps in existing proxy records have often been bridged by simple averaging, without taking into account the spatial distribution of samples, leading to biased temperature reconstructions. Here, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model to integrate ecological data with established geochemical proxies into a unified quantitative framework, bridging gaps in the latitudinal coverage of proxy data. We apply this approach to the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO), the interval with the warmest sustained temperatures of the Cenozoic. Assuming the conservation of thermal tolerances of modern coral reefs and mangrove taxa, we establish broad sea surface temperature ranges for EECO coral reef and mangrove sites. We integrate these temperature estimates with the EECO geochemical shallow marine proxy record to model the latitudinal sea surface temperature gradient and global average temperatures of the EECO. Our results confirm the presence of a flattened latitudinal temperature gradient and unusually high polar temperatures during the EECO, which is supported by high-latitude ecological data. We show that integrating multiple types of proxy data, and adequate prior information, has the potential to enhance quantiative palaeoclimate reconstructions, allowing for more accurate temperature estimates from  data with incomplete spatial sampling.

<!--Geochemical data such as oxygen isotopes (d18O), tetraether indices (TEX86) and magnesium calcium ratios (Mg/Ca) are routinely used to reconstruct ocean temperatures in deep time. However, limited spatial coverage and disagreements between geochemical proxies compromise the accuracy of these reconstructions. Geological data such as coral reefs, mangroves, and evaporites have the potential to supplement geochemical data by improving spatial coverage and constraining temperature estimates. Historically, these data have been used to qualitatively inform upon palaeoclimatic conditions at broad spatial scales, yet no transfer functions exist to convert geological data into temperature estimates. Quantitative temperature reconstructions have therefore not made use of these data. Likewise, the large spatial gaps in existing proxy records have often been bridged by simple averaging, without taking into consideration the spatial distribution of the samples. Here, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model to integrate geological data–with established temperature proxies–into a unified quantitative framework. We apply this approach to the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO), the interval with the warmest sustained temperatures of the Cenozoic. Assuming the conservation of thermal tolerances of modern coral reefs and mangrove taxa, we establish broad sea surface temperature ranges for EECO coral reef and mangrove sites. We integrate these temperature estimates with the EECO geochemical shallow marine proxy record to model the latitudinal temperature gradient and its uncertainty. Our results confirm the presence of a flattened latitudinal temperature gradient and unusually high polar temperatures during the EECO. We show that the inclusion of ecological data can substantially reduce the uncertainty on temperature estimates in climate zones lacking geochemical data. -->

# Introduction

Understanding the long-term evolution of Earth's climate system and contextualising current global warming relies on accurate reconstructions of past climates [@Royer2004; @Burke2018; @Tierney2020]. Recent advances in the synthesis of palaeoclimate data [e.g. @Veizer2015; @Hollis2019; @song2019; @Grossman2022; @Judd2022] are offering unprecedented insights into the complex and dynamic nature of the Earth's climate system, yet a fundamental challenge remains: the proxy record of past climates is spatially incomplete and afflicted by imperfect preservation and uneven sampling [@judd2020; @Jones2022; @Judd2022].

Acknowledging the assumptions and limitations inherent in geochemical temperature proxies, e.g. experimentally derived calibrations, influences from seasonality, dissolution effects and differential preservation [e.g. @Tierney2017], can allow for robust estimates of palaeotemperatures at a local scale. However, recent work has demonstrated that spatial biases in the geochemical proxy record can lead to spurious estimates of regional (e.g. latitudinal temperature gradients) and global temperatures [@judd2020; @Jones2022]. Principally, this can be driven by two factors: (1) missing data for some regions (e.g. no high-latitude data); or (2) overrepresentation of other regions (e.g. a high proportion of samples from tropical areas). The latter can be addressed through the down-sampling of data or restricting analyses to specific regions [e.g. @song2019]. However, in order to robustly infer regional or global-scale patterns from an incomplete record, spatial gaps must ultimately be bridged. One common approach, which requires no additional computation, is the spatial visualisation of proxy-derived temperatures against latitude, showing broad latitudinal temperature trends [@Hollis2019; @Vickers2021]. Interpolation is also sometimes used to bridge spatial gaps in palaeoclimate data [@Taylor2004], taking advantage of the autoregressive nature of climatic data: much of the information on the climate of any given location is contained in the climate data of nearby locations [@Reynolds1994]. Adding to this, some proxy-based reconstructions use statistical modelling to infer palaeoclimatic patterns. For example, polynomial regression [@Bijl2009] and cosine functions [@Inglis2020] have been used to reconstruct latitudinal temperature gradients, and 2D-reconstructions of surface temperatures have been created with Gaussian process regression [@Inglis2020]. These approaches work well for interpolating relatively densely-sampled data, but the absence of constraints on the modelled parameters means that such models can produce unrealistic temperature estimates when extrapolating from sparse data. Statistical modelling in a Bayesian framework can help overcome this problem by requiring the explicit specification of priors for the model parameters, which can be used to express physical constraints [@Chandra2021].

Spatial gaps in the palaeoclimate record can also be addressed through the integration of additional data. For example, lithological and fossil data can be used to infer past climatic conditions based on analogous modern sediments [@Chandra2021], or based on the premise that the climatic requirements of ancient taxa, biological traits, or ecological communities were similar to those of their nearest modern relatives [@Peppe2011; @Royer2012; @Salonen2019]. Despite this potential, the integration of geochemical proxy data with other sources of information (e.g. ecological data) has rarely been realised in a rigorous, quantitative framework [@Burgener2023].

Here, we present a novel Bayesian hierarchical model [see e.g. @Gelman2013; @Mcelreath2018] that combines quantitative proxies and ecological constraints into a fully quantitative model of the latitudinal gradient of sea surface temperatures, bridging spatial gaps in sparsely sampled climate data. The Bayesian approach offers a powerful framework for integrating various sources of uncertainty and modelling complex hierarchical relationships, and is increasingly used in palaeoclimatic reconstructions [e.g. @Weitzel2019; @Yang2022; @Burgener2023]. This model expands upon existing, spatially explicit palaeoclimatic reconstructions  by allowing for the integration of (1) prior information based on physical principles and the observed modern sea surface temperature distribution, and of (2) geochemical and ecological climate proxies in a common, quantitative framework. We chose a generalised logistic function to accurately infer the shape of the temperature gradient despite a patchy latitudinal coverage. This choice is motivated by the flexibility and ability of this function to approximate a variety of nonlinear patterns in the underlying temperature gradients, that other parametric approaches, such as lower order polynomials [e.g. @Bijl2009; @Keating-Bitoni2011], lack. We test the robustness of this method using down-sampled, simulated temperature gradients. 

We apply this model to the record of the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO), combining a compilation of geochemical proxies [@Hollis2019], mangrove communities [@Popescu2021], and coral reefs [@Zamagni2012]. We use a nearest-living-relative approach [e.g. @Greenwood2017] to establish broad temperature ranges for the ecological data. We choose the EECO to demonstrate the application of the model due to its significance as the interval with the warmest sustained temperatures of the Cenozoic [@Pross2012], rendering it a potential analogue for extreme climate warming scenarios [@Burke2018]. Our integrative approach allows us to shed new light on the long-standing dispute on the steepness of the early Eocene temperature gradient [Table 1\; @Sloan1990; @Markwick1994; @Huber2011; @Tierney2017; @Inglis2020].

## Geochemical data

Geochemical climate proxy data were extracted from a latest Paleocene and early Eocene compilation [@Hollis2019]. This compilation provides sea surface temperature data on four different geochemical proxies for reconstructing seawater temperature: &delta;^18^O, &Delta;~47~, Mg/Ca and TEX~86~. For our analyses, this dataset was restricted to the EECO (defined as 53.8--49.1 Ma) and samples originating from near the ocean surface or mixed layer. Samples labelled as "thermocline" or "sub-thermocline" were excluded. Recrystallised &delta;^18^O samples were also excluded as secondary diagenetic calcite precipitated after deposition can bias isotope measurements and offset temperature values [@Schrag1999]. This filtering resulted in most &delta;^18^O samples being excluded from the dataset (retaining 8 out of 152). After data filtering, `r n_geochem` geochemical proxy samples from `r n_geochem_location` locations remained (Fig. 1). For a detailed description of each proxy see @Hollis2019.

## Ecological data

**Coral reefs.** Today, shallow warm-water coral reefs are limited to tropical and subtropical latitudes (\~34&deg;&nbsp;N--32&deg;&nbsp;S), with minimum sea surface temperature tolerances (\~18&deg;C) being the primary constraint on this distribution [@johannes1983; @kleypas1999; @yamano2001]. As coral reefs reside at the upper thermal limit of the oceans today, their maximum sea surface temperature tolerance is less well-constrained, with some studies suggesting up to 35.6&deg;C in the geological past [@jones2022reef]. Nevertheless, coral reefs have frequently been recognised as tracers of past (sub-)tropical conditions [@ziegler1984; @kiessling2001]. During the Eocene, coral communities and reefs expanded across tropical and temperate latitudes, with communities found up to palaeolatitudes of 43&deg;&nbsp;N [@Zamagni2012]. Using a compilation of Paleocene--early Eocene coral reefs and community localities [@Zamagni2012], we generated quantitative sea surface temperature estimates for the ECCO. To do so, we extracted localities from the compilation that are inferred to be Ilerdian (early Eocene) coral reefs, and that could be confidently assigned to the EECO. We excluded coral knobs and coral-bearing mounds which might have broader climatic limits than warm-water coral reef ecosystems. This filtering resulted in four unique coral reef localities remaining for the EECO, all of which conform to the modern latitudinal range of coral reefs (\<34&deg;&nbsp;N). Subsequently, we used statistically derived temperature limits (minimum = 21&deg;C, average = 27.6&deg;C, maximum = 29.5&deg;C) from the published literature [@kleypas1999] to define a normal probability distribution of potential temperature values for coral reef localities. This normal probability distribution was defined with a mean of 27.6&deg;C and a standard deviation of 2.125&deg;C, which places the minimum (21&deg;C) at the lower end of the 95% highest density interval of that distribution. As the distribution of modern corals is skewed towards warmer temperatures, this approach results in 16.5% of the probability being placed on temperatures \> 29.5&deg;C, allowing for the possibility that Eocene coral reefs were adapted to warmer conditions than present-day coral reefs.

**Mangroves.** Mangroves are distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics today. While factors besides sea surface temperatures (SST) influence the distribution of mangroves, empirical lower temperature limits have been established for the genera *Avicennia* (15.6&deg;C) and *Rhizophora* (20.7&deg;C) [@Quisthoudt2012]. Both *Avicennia* and members of the Rhizophoraceae family were widespread and co-occurred across tropical and temperate latitudes in the early Eocene. Only *Avicennia*, however, occurred at polar latitudes [@Suan2017; @Popescu2021]. Assuming that Eocene members of these mangrove taxa conform to similar climatic requirements as their modern relatives, the presence and absence of *Avicennia* and Rhizophoraceae pollen can be used as a palaeotemperature indicator. For this analysis, published mangrove occurrence data were taken from @Popescu2021, and converted to quantitative temperature estimates. From this data, we identify two types of pollen assemblages which we ascribe different temperature distributions:

1)  *Avicennia*-only assemblages ($n=2$): the absence of Rhizophoraceae is indicative of temperatures between 15.6&deg;C (lower temperature limt of *Avicennia*) and 20.7&deg;C (lower temperature limit of *Rhizophora*). However, a value of 22.5&deg;C is assumed as the upper temperature limit here as *Rhizophora* is rare below this temperature. We define the *Avicennia*-only temperature distribution as a normal distribution with a mean of 19.05&deg;C and a standard deviation of 1.725&deg;C, resulting in 95% of the probability density being placed within the temperature limits.

2)  *Avicennia* and Rhizophoraceae assemblages ($n=5$): the presence of both groups suggests that the locality should have a minimum temperature of 20.7&deg;C (lower temperature limit of *Rhizophora*). As the upper thermal limits of *Aviciennia* and *Rhizophora* are not well established in @Quisthoudt2012, we assign the same maximum temperature limits (29.5&deg;C) as coral reef localities, because mangroves are also widely distributed throughout tropical regions. Consequently, we define the temperature distribution for this locality as a normal distribution with a mean of 25.1&deg;C and a standard deviation of 2.2&deg;C, with 95% probability density within the temperature limits.

## Palaeogeographic reconstruction

The palaeogeographic distribution of geochemical and ecological data was reconstructed using the @merdith2021 plate rotation model via the palaeoverse R package [version 1.2.0, @jones2023]. The midpoint age of the EECO (51.2 Ma), along with the present-day coordinates of geochemical and ecological data, were used for palaeogeographic reconstruction.

## Bayesian framework

**Model structure.** We model the mean temperature ($\mu$) at location $j$ as a function of absolute latitude ($abs(l)$) with a logistic regression (also known as "growth curve" or "Richard's curve") of the form:

$$\mu_{j}  \sim N(\nu_j, \sigma), $${#eq-mu}

$$\nu_{j} = A~+\frac{K-A}{1+e^{B(abs(l_j)-M)}}~, ~~~~~ j = 1,...,n,  $${#eq-nu} where $A$ and $K$ denote the lower and upper asymptote, respectively, $M$ specifies the latitude of maximal growth, i.e. the latitude around which temperature falls most steeply with latitude, $B$ denotes the growth rate, $\sigma$ denotes the residual standard deviation, and $n$ denotes the number of locations.

We use this generalised logistic function because it can follow the equatorial and polar asymptotes observed in the modern, latitudinal SST gradient, but can also accommodate a variety of other shapes, while consisting of only four shape parameters. This flexibility is primarily achieved by shifting the location of the curve along the latitudinal axis by varying $M$, and by altering the steepness of the curve by varying $B$. For example, one limb of a second-order polynomial as in @Bijl2009 can be approximated by increasing $M$ towards high latitudes, and decreasing $B$ to reduce the steepness of the curve. The model is designed for modelling the average gradient across both hemispheres, but can also be applied to individual hemispheres, to assess hemispherical differences (Supplementary Material).

We infer $\mu_j$ from $m$ individual temperature observations $t_{i = 1,...m}$, derived from geochemical data, at location $j$ as

$$t_{i,j}  \sim N(\mu_j, \sigma_j), ~~~~~ i = 1,...,m,  $${#eq-obs} where $m$ is the number of observations at each location, and $\sigma_j$ is the estimated standard deviation of the temperatures at location $j$.

Similarly, $\mu_j$ is inferred for locations with ecological proxies from the associated normal temperature distributions with a given mean and standard deviation, $t_{\mu,j}$ and $t_{\sigma,j}$, as

$$t_{\mu,j}  \sim N(\mu_j,t_{\sigma,j}).  $${#eq-dist}

This structure implies that $\mu_j$ is not fixed at the mean proxy temperature at location $j$, <!--of the temperatures $t_{i=1,...,m,~j}$ of location $j$--> but is drawn towards the overall logistic regression curve, i.e. towards $\nu_j$. The pull towards $\nu_j$ tends to be strong when $m$ is low, when the observations $t_{i=1,...,m,~j}$ are scattered, i.e. $\sigma_j$ is high, and/or when the overall standard deviation $\sigma$ is low. In practice, this has the desirable consequence that locations with few observations and large temperature differences between observations have less influence on the overall regression than well-sampled locations with consistent reconstructed temperatures.

We show an expanded model that includes uncertainties on individual temperature observations in the Supplementary Material.

**Priors.** In a Bayesian framework, priors need to be placed on the unknown parameters of a model. We placed weakly informative, conjugate inverse-gamma priors on $\sigma$ and $\sigma_{j=1,..n}$: $$\sigma  \sim \sqrt{Inv-Gamma(\alpha+\frac{n}{2},\beta + 0.5\times(\mu_j-\nu_j))}, ~~~~~ j = 1,...,n,  $${#eq-sigma}
$$\sigma_j  \sim \sqrt{Inv-Gamma(\alpha+\frac{m}{2},\beta + 0.5\times(t_{i,j}-\mu_j))}, ~~~~~ i = 1,...,m,~~~~~j = 1,...,n. $${#eq-sigmaj}
We set $\alpha = \beta = 1$, allowing these priors to be quickly overwhelmed by the data as $n$ and $m$ increase, as we have little *a priori* knowledge of these parameters.

In contrast, we put informative priors on the regression coefficients $A$, $K$, $M$ and $B$, based on physical principles, and loosely based on the modern climate system:

**A.** Predicted seawater surface temperatures are not allowed to be $<< -2^\circ C$, the freezing point of sea water. The highest prior density of $A$ is placed around $0^\circ C$, and it slowly tapers off towards higher temperatures. This shape is achieved by placing a skew-normal prior on the lower asymptote, specified as $$A \sim SN(\xi=-3.0,\omega=12,\alpha_{SN}=30),$${#eq-A}
where $\xi$, $\omega$, and $\alpha_{SN}$ are the location, scale and shape parameters.

**K.** Input of solar energy decreases from the tropics to the poles. Hence, the latitudinal temperature gradient is broadly negative, i.e. temperature decreases with absolute latitude. This is achieved by setting $K \ge A$. The prior on the upper asymptote $K$ is a truncated normal distribution with the mean set to $K$ of the modern SST gradient, with a broad standard deviation: $$K \sim TN(\mu_{TN} = 28, \sigma_{TN} = 10, \alpha_{TN} = A, \beta_{TN}= \infty)$${#eq-K}
The distribution is truncated to the left at $\alpha_{TN}=A$, but not truncated to the right ($\beta_{TN}$).

**M.** The steepness of the gradient is presumed to be highest in mid-latitudes; this is expressed with a normal prior on $M$ with the mean set to 42, i.e. $M$ of the modern SST gradient, and a moderately wide standard deviation of 10: $$M \sim N(42,10)$${#eq-M} 

**B.** The steepness or growth rate $B$ of the gradient is constrained to be $\ge0$ and to not be exceedingly high, as oceanic and atmospheric heat transfer is bound to limit very abrupt SST changes across latitudes on a global scale. A gamma-distributed prior of the form $$B \sim Gamma(\alpha_G=4.3,\beta_G=30)$${#eq-B}
was placed on $B$. The shape and rate parameters $\alpha_G$ and $\beta_G$ were chosen such that the highest prior density is at $B$ of the modern SST gradient, $0.11$. We informed the prior distributions on $M$ and $B$ based on a provisional model run with the modern SST data.

## Model validation

To test whether our logistic regression model can adequately describe different latitudinal temperature gradients at various sample sizes, we used the empirical, modern gradient, representative of an icehouse climate, and generated three idealised gradients that emulate potential climatic states throughout Earth's geological history: extreme icehouse, icehouse (modern), greenhouse, and extreme greenhouse [@Frakes1992]. The idealised gradients serve to test whether our model setup is able to infer gradients that are strongly different from the modern from a varying amount of samples. 

We created test data from these gradients as follows: We randomly sampled (1000 iterations) latitudes at sample sizes of 5, 10 and 20, with the probability of a latitude being sampled scaling with the decreasing surface area towards higher latitudes; i.e. lower latitudes are sampled more frequently. For the largest sample size (n = 34), we used the latitudes of the EECO data set of this study in all iterations. For each latitude, we inferred a location mean temperature from the gradients, adding random noise from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 3.8, which is the average standard deviation of the EECO geochemical proxy data. With that, we aim to simulate randomly distributed errors in the proxy data, which could arise from miscalibrations, measurement errors, seasonal effects, ect. We acknowledge that this approach cannot quantify the potential impact of systematic offsets that may bias all proxy data in the same direction, nor do we know whether a standard deviation of 3.8 is actual, average magnitude of uncertainty that the proxy compilation is afflicted with.

To evaluate how well the model performed in reconstructing the idealised gradients from limited sampling, we calculated the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) for Bayesian regression models [@Gelman2019]. For every iteration from the posterior, we intercepted the modelled and the idealised gradient in intervals of 1&deg; latitude and calculated the $R^2$ based on these values. We report the median, and 95% credible intervals (CI) of the resulting $R^2$ values. Here and in all other instances, the 95% CI refer to the interval between the 2.5% point and the 97.5% point of the samples or sampled posterior distribution.

To test whether our model can accurately depict the shape of the modern sea surface temperature gradient, and to facilitate comparison with the Eocene gradient, we applied our model to annual sea surface mean temperatures from Bio-Oracle [@Assis2018], aggregated to a $1^\circ \times 1 ^\circ$ raster (*n* = 46,131). The $R^2$ for the modern gradient was calculated as above [@Gelman2019], comparing the modelled gradient and the empirical temperature averages in 1&deg; latitude bins. Only the medians are reported for the modern gradient, as the 95% credible intervals are extremely narrow due to the high precision of the posterior estimates. 

To reconstruct the idealised gradients and the modern gradient, we used a simplified, non-hierarchical version of our model, as every location is associated with only one temperature value, making the hierarchical structure superfluous. To achieve this, we substituted temperature ($t_j$) for $\mu_j$ in [@eq-mu] and [@eq-sigma].

## Parameter estimation

We estimated the posterior distributions of the model parameters using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, written in R. Specifically, we sampled the unknown parameters $A$, $K$, $M$ and $B$ with Metropolis-Hastings, and used Gibbs sampling to estimate all other unknown parameters [see @Gilks1995; @Gelman2013]. Posterior inference on the modern gradient is based on four chains with 60,000 iterations each, 10,000 of which were discarded as burn-in. Every 10th iteration was retained, resulting in a total of 20,000 iterations with low autocorrelation. The re-sampled, simulated gradients were modelled in one chain with 10,000 iterations for each of the 1,000 random samples. 5,000 iterations each were discarded as burn-in, and every 25th iteration was kept, resulting in a total of 200,000 iterations across all 1,000 model runs. For the simulated gradients with an Eocene sampling distribution, a single chain with 250,000 iterations was used, thinned to 10,000 iterations after burn-in. For the Eocene model, we ran four chains with 600,000 iterations each, discarding 100,000 as burn-in and keeping every 100th iteration, as the hierarchical model structure results in higher autocorrelation of the chains. The Eocene posterior inference is thus based on a total of 20,000 iterations with low autocorrelation (effective multivariate sample size for $A$, $K$, $M$ and $B$ is \> 18,000). Trace plots of the MCMC chains indicate convergence and good mixing of the chains (Fig. S1).

Modelled sea surface temperature estimates were generated with [@eq-nu], calculating the sea surface temperatures at any latitude with the parameter estimates of each iteration from the posterior. The median and 95% CI of temperatures were then taken from all temperature estimates obtained at the latitudes of interest.

The latitudinal gradient was calculated as the difference between the modelled temperature at the equator (0&deg; latitude) and at the poles (90&deg; absolute latitude). To facilitate comparison with earlier estimates, we also calculated the gradient with the temperature at the polar circle (66.6&deg; absolute latitude) being used instead of the temperature at the poles. 

Differences between Eocene and modern temperatures at a certain latitude were calculated by randomly pairing all iterations of the posterior from the Eocene and modern temperature gradient model, calculating the Eocene and modern temperature using the respective iterations, taking the difference, and then calculating the median (95% CI) from all pairs of iterations.  

Global average temperatures with 95% credible intervals were calculated by taking the weighted mean of the median (95% CI) of temperature estimates in 1&deg; latitudinal bins. The weights were set to the proportion of global surface area in each latitudinal bin, i.e. decreasing with increasing latitude as: $$weights = sin(\alpha_{1,i}) - sin(\alpha_{2,i}) ,$${#eq-weights} where $\alpha_1$ is the upper, and $\alpha_2$ is the lower latitudinal boundary of bin $i$, i.e. we approximated the shape of the globe as a spheroid.

Each column depicts a different reconstruction for given sample sizes: 5, 10, 20, and 34 (latitudes of EECO samples). Each row depicts a different simulated latitudinal temperature gradient that represents idealised climatic states: extreme icehouse, icehouse, greenhouse, and extreme greenhouse. The black line illustrates the simulated gradient. The blue line depicts the reconstructed gradient represented by the median sea surface temperature value estimated from 1,000 model runs with different random samples (first three columns), and a single run with the EECO latitudinal sampling distribution (fourth column). To generate the random samples, noise from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 3.8 was added to all temperatures. The blue shadings depict the 90%, 95%, and 99% credible intervals. Bold black text within each panel depicts the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) for estimating goodness of fit between the simulated and modelled gradient.

:::

Our Bayesian model is able to accurately model a range of idealised temperature gradients, ranging from extreme icehouse to 'super greenhouse' scenarios (Fig. 2). Random latitudinal sampling results in highly accurate reconstructions at a sample sizes as low as 10 for the icehouse scenarios (95 % CI of $R^2$ > 0.9). Greenhouse scenarios require additional samples to accurately predict high-latitude temperatures. This is because in the absence of high-latitude samples, the modelled gradient is heavily influenced by the priors, which we based on the modern, the only empirically known latitudinal temperature gradient. A sampling distribution resembling that of the early Eocene data set used in this study allows for a highly accurate reconstruction of even the extreme greenhouse scenario (95 % CI of $R^2$ > 0.95).

The average, modern temperature gradient can be closely approximated with our model when using the full modern SST dataset (Fig. 3); almost all of the variation in the empirical median temperatures in bins of 1&deg; absolute latitude (black line) is explained by the modelled gradient ($`r 100*as.numeric(R2_modern_median)` \%$). The empirical gradient spans `r modern_gradient_empirical`&deg;C from the equator to the poles, the modelled gradient is only slightly higher at `r modern_gradient$"50%"`&deg;C. The modern, global mean temperature (GMST) based on our modelled, median gradient is `r motemp_global$"50%"`&deg;C, very similar to the GMST derived from the empirical median gradient (`r motemp_empirical_global`&deg;C).

<!-- REMOVED
Reducing the amount and the spatial coverage of data points to match the early Eocene sampling distribution ($n = 34$) still results in a close match of the modelled gradient with the empirical gradient (Fig. 3b). The 95% credible interval (CI) of reconstructed gradients (Fig. 3b) is noticeably narrower than the spread of empirical temperature values (Fig. 3a). The modern, latitudinal gradient, modelled with all data, spans `r modern_gradient$"50%"`&deg;C from the equator to the poles. When modelled with only the early Eocene sampling locations, the median temperature gradient is `r modern_eocene_gradient$"50%"` (95% CI: `r modern_eocene_gradient$"2.5%"`--`r modern_eocene_gradient$"97.5%"`)&deg;C. A random sampling of modern temperatures at latitudes corresponding to the sampled Eocene palaeolatitudes would thus allow the reconstruction of the modern latitudinal temperature gradient with good accuracy, with expected deviations from the actual gradient as low as `r modern_eocene_gradient_diff$"2.5%"` to `r modern_eocene_gradient_diff$"97.5%"`&deg;C (95 % CI).

Additional model runs with simulated SST data show that latitudinal gradients following a flat, linear or quadratic function can also be adequately reconstructed by our model (Fig. S4). The generalised logistic function underlying the reconstruction leads to the inferred gradient being pushed towards a sigmoidal shape in the absence of proxies (see very high latitudes in Fig. S4a,c). This is intended, as in the absence of data, the shape of the reconstructed gradient should be broadly similar to the sigmoidal shape of the modern SST gradient, as it is the only empirically observed SST gradient.

modelling the latitudinal temperature gradient facilitates accurate reconstruction of global mean surface temperatures (GMST). The modern, global mean sea surface temperature (GMsST) estimate is `r motemp_global$"50%"`&deg;C when using the full, modern data set. When reduced to the early Eocene sampling distribution, the modern GMsST is estimated at `r moeotemp_global$"50%"` (`r moeotemp_global$"2.5%"`--`r moeotemp_global$"97.5%"`)&deg;C. The deviations from the full modern estimate are again very low, with a 95 % credible interval of `r moeotemp_global_diff$"2.5%"` to `r moeotemp_global_diff$"97.5%"`&deg;C.
-->

## EECO reconstruction

The Eocene temperature gradient reconstructed with our Bayesian model is starkly different from the modern (Fig. 4). Modelled, median equatorial temperatures are `r tdiff_lat0$"50%"` (95% CI: `r tdiff_lat0$"2.5%"`--`r tdiff_lat0$"97.5%"`)&deg;C higher for the EECO, and polar temperatures are `r tdiff_lat90$"50%"` (`r tdiff_lat90$"2.5%"`--`r tdiff_lat90$"97.5%"`)&deg;C higher. This results in a flattened latitudinal temperature gradient of `r eocene_gradient$"50%"` (`r eocene_gradient$"2.5%"`--`r eocene_gradient$"97.5%"`)&deg;C for the EECO, as opposed to `r modern_gradient$"50%"`&deg;C for the modern. To facilitate the comparison with latitudinal gradients reported in the literature, which sometimes do not report temperatures at very high latitudes, we report also the EECO gradient between the equator and the modern-day polar circle (66.6&deg;), which is a lot lower at `r eocene_gradient_polar_circle$"50%"` (`r eocene_gradient_polar_circle$"2.5%"`--`r eocene_gradient_polar_circle$"97.5%"`)&deg;C.

The high variability of EECO palaeotemperature proxies, particularly in the mid-latitudes, and the scarcity of high-latitude data, result in substantial uncertainties in the modelled temperature gradient. This is reflected in the residual standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the EECO gradient--`r eeco_sdy$"50%"` (`r eeco_sdy$"2.5%"`--`r eeco_sdy$"97.5%"`)&deg;C--which is more than double the  $\sigma$ for the modern gradient, `r modern_sdy$"50%"`. This is illustrated by the drastic departure of some of the proxy data from the gradient estimates (Fig. 4).

The early Eocene GMST is estimated at `r eotemp_global$"50%"` (`r eotemp_global$"2.5%"`--`r eotemp_global$"97.5%"`)&deg;C, `r  round(as.numeric(eotemp_global$"50%") - as.numeric(motemp_global$"50%"),1)`&deg;C higher than the modern. A model run excluding the ecological proxies increases the GMST by `r eoceneproxy_global_diff$"50%"` (`r eoceneproxy_global_diff$"2.5%"`--`r eoceneproxy_global_diff$"97.5%"`)&deg;C. The median modelled temperature is higher near the equator and in high latitudes when excluding the ecological proxies, with a flattened median gradient of `r eocene_proxy_gradient$"50%"`&deg;C (Fig. S2). In contrast, including ecological proxies, but widening the uncertainty around the low-latitude ecological proxy data does not significantly change the resulting gradient (Fig. S3). 

Due to the limited spatial coverage of the early Eocene proxy record, and due to the added model complexity of simultaneously estimating a model across both hemispheres, we pooled the proxy data across both hemispheres. Applying the model separately within each hemisphere results in substantial differences in hemispherical, average temperatures, with the Southern Hemisphere being warmer by `r eeco_south_north_global_diff$"50%"` (`r eeco_south_north_global_diff$"2.5%"`--`r eeco_south_north_global_diff$"97.5%"`)&deg;C. The inferred latitudinal gradient is somewhat steeper in the Northern Hemisphere (steeper by `r eocene_north_south_gradient_diff$"50%"`&deg;C, although the 95% CI spans `r eocene_north_south_gradient_diff$"2.5%"`--`r eocene_north_south_gradient_diff$"97.5%"`&deg;C), but the large uncertainties associated with both gradients, and the lack of polar proxy data in the Southern Hemisphere preclude a more precise statement (see Fig. S4).

# Discussion

## Improved estimation of latitudinal and global palaeotemperatures

Our results show that our Bayesian model can be used to reconstruct different types of latitudinal SST gradients from proxy data with moderate sample sizes (*n* = 10--34) and patchy sampling distributions (Fig. 2). This is an advancement over previously used linear, quadratic or Gaussian approximations [e.g. @Bijl2009; @Tierney2017], which can fit only specific types of gradients. As such, our model presents an alternative to non-parametric methods for inferring latitudinal temperature gradients, which are sometimes favoured as they can flexibly follow the shape of an unknown temperature gradient [e.g. @Zhang2019; @Jones2022]. However, when used for interpolation or prediction outside the proxy range, non-parametric methods such as Gaussian process regression strictly respond to the data [e.g. @Inglis2020]. This means that the idiosyncrasies of a patchy proxy record, potentially afflicted with measurement errors, calibration errors, and palaeogeographic and temporal uncertainty, dictate the reconstruction of large-scale climate patterns, without the option of including additional knowledge (e.g. that latitudinal temperature gradients should be broadly negative). 

In contrast, our Bayesian, parametric model allows for the inclusion of informative priors on the model parameters. The modelled sea surface temperature gradient thus does not strictly follow the proxy data, but instead represents a compromise between the data and prior knowledge. In the EECO example (Fig. 4), the inclusion of informative priors improves the prediction of sea surface temperatures in the unsampled, very high latitudes: Notice that the upper limit of the credible interval does not increase beyond the range of the data, whereas unconstrained approaches such as splines, Gaussian processes or even standard linear regression could lead to unrealistically high upper bounds in this case [see @Rasmussen2004]. Prior information on the shape of latitudinal temperature gradients on Earth exists for all geological time periods. For example, the greater amount of solar radiation per unit area in low latitudes causes Earth's latitudinal temperature gradient to be broadly negative [@Beer2008]. The ease with which such prior information can be integrated is a major advantage of our method, as the shape of the modelled gradient is controlled by four parameters which clearly relate to its magnitude, steepness and the latitude of its greatest steepness.

Palaeoclimate reconstructions are often summarised as global mean surface temperatures (GMST), providing a standardised metric for characterising the state of the Earth's climate [@Royer2004; @Inglis2020]. The calculation of global mean surface temperatures directly from sparse proxy data is susceptible to bias [@Jones2022]. By modelling the temperature variation across latitudes, a complete temperature distribution along a latitudinal axis can be obtained, filling in gaps in the proxy record through inter- or extrapolation. This eliminates the common problem that specific climate zones dominate the proxy record. Reconstructing the GMST directly from the proxies would lead to an estimate biased towards the well-sampled latitudes. Calculating zonal averages alleviates this problem, but this method relies on comprehensive latitudinal coverage [@Inglis2020]. Instead, our method allows for intersecting the modelled temperature gradient at narrow latitudinal intervals, even when significant latitudinal gaps exist. Weighting the temperatures of those latitudinal intervals by area results in GMST estimates without intrinsic spatial biases. We anticipate that this improved method may significantly alter Phanerozoic, proxy-based temperature curves, which have often been directly calculated from the proxy record [@Royer2004; @Veizer2015]. This is particularly relevant for the early Mesozoic and older intervals, for which the spatial coverage is generally poor due to the absence of data from ocean drilling sites [@Jones2022].

## The role of ecological constraints in palaeoclimate reconstructions

Our results further exemplify how incorporating quantified ecological temperature constraints can provide more precise temperature reconstructions than geochemical proxies alone, adding to the advances in palaeoclimate reconstructions achieved by integrating lithological data [@Scotese2021; @Burgener2023]. Combining the occurrences of climate-sensitive plant communities [@Greenwood1995], reptiles [@Markwick2007], leaf shapes [@Peppe2011], with geochemical proxies offers substantial potential for improving quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions across the Phanerozoic. Our modelling framework offers a straightforward, efficient way of integrating ecological climate data with other proxy data: The hierarchical model structure accounts for variation of temperature estimates from proxies at individual localities, which is treated equivalent to the uncertainty associated with the ecological temperature proxies. A local temperature estimate, based on multiple geochemical proxies, thus has the same weight as a local temperature estimate obtained from the occurrence of a climate-sensitive plant community, whilst preserving the uncertainty associated with each estimate. The model could easily be extended to include uncertainties on individual geochemical proxy data, or to variably weight proxy records classified as more or less reliable.

Our approach for deriving fully quantitative climate reconstructions from ecological data is borrowed from nearest living relative methods, commonly employed in terrestrial, Cenozoic climate reconstructions [@Fauquette2007; @Pross2012]. One major limitation to these methods is that the thermal preferences of taxa may have changed over time. More significantly, in the early Eocene, sea surface temperatures may have reached heights unknown in the modern world, and nearest living relative methods based on the modern are inherently unable to predict such elevated temperatures. This is especially true for taxa that inhabit the warmest part of the ocean today, e.g. coral reefs [@kleypas1999]. Although coral reefs are threatened by warming sea surface temperatures today [@Hoegh2011], it is conceivable that Eocene reef corals were adapted to a warmer climate. The fossil record indicates that reef development may have been stunted in the early Eocene, with few early Eocene coral reefs occurring in low latitudes [@Zamagni2012]. The absence of coral reefs in higher latitudes in the early Eocene could be due to requirements in irradiance, rather than temperature [@Muir2015]. Tropical temperatures predicted by the geochemical proxy record indicate hotter-than-modern tropical temperatures for the early Eocene (Fig.&nbsp;S2), suggesting that the modern climate range of coral reefs may underestimate the early Eocene thermal niche for coral reefs. We have tried to account for that possibility by widening the temperature probability distribution for coral reefs, but the predicted temperatures for the reef and mangrove sites still lie below the temperatures indicated by the geochemical proxy record (Fig. 4, Fig. S2).


<!-- This dilemma could be resolved in future studies by applying machine learning approaches to inferring quantitative temperatures from ecological and lithological proxies: If geochemical proxies and ecological or lithological data are derived from the same location and time interval, the climatic requirements of these taxa or sediments can be learned by using palaeotemperatures from that time interval, instead of or in addition to modern modern temperatures. This approach would ultimately rely on geochemical proxies providing absolute temperature estimates, but the resulting information could be exported to other locations lacking good coverage of geochemical proxies via their fossil or sedimentary record. -->

## Early Eocene climate

The geochemical proxy record and ecological data indicate that the latitudinal SST gradient of the early Eocene climatic optimum was significantly shallower than the modern [@Huber2011], but beyond that, there is little agreement. Earlier, reconstructed early Eocene and EECO SST gradients range from 7--21&deg;C (Table 1); a more recent reconstruction that includes terrestrial air and sea surface temperatures arrives at a gradient of ~13&deg;C [@Inglis2020]. Our median poles-to-equator gradient estimate is similar at `r eocene_gradient$"50%"`&deg;C, but a lot less steep when taking the equator-to-polar-circle estimate, `r eocene_gradient_polar_circle$"50%"`, as the geochemical proxy data suggest high temperatures up to latitudes of ~ 60&deg. Both geochemical and ecological shallow water data indicate that inferred SST gradients based on tropical, shallow water and deep water samples [@Cramwinckel2018; @Evans2018] may overestimate the SST gradient of the early Eocene greenhouse world. Likewise, climate simulations using general circulation or Earth system models tend to estimate steeper gradients than most proxy records [Table 1\; @Pross2012; @Lunt2021]

<!-- @Evans2018 estimate the SST gradient at 32+-10% of the modern, which would correspond to \~`r round( as.numeric(modern_gradient$"50%") - 0.32*as.numeric(modern_gradient$"50%"),0)`+- `r format(round( 0.10*as.numeric(modern_gradient$"50%"),0),nsmall=0)`&deg;C, using the difference between the mean tropical and deep ocean data. The modelled SST of @Tierney2017 using TEX86 is \~ `r round(35.8-23.8,0)`&deg;C, when taking the difference between temperatures at the polar circles and the equator. @Inglis2020 include both terrestrial air temperature and SST estimates in their model of the latitudinal temperature gradient in their Figure S4a; they model a polar circle to equatorial gradient of \~ `r round(30.7-(20.2+14.3)/2,0)`&deg;C. All of those estimates are significantly lower than the SST gradient predicted by an EECO climate model ensemble [@Lunt2012, as shown in @Tierney2017], which predicts a polar circle to equatorial gradient of `r round(31.5-5.5,0)`&deg;C. @Keating-Bitonti2011 show a proxy-based SST gradient of \~ `r round(30-(19+15.6)/2,0)`&deg;C, and @Bijl2009 model a gradient of \~`r round(36-27,0)`&deg;C in the northern and only \~`r 36-31`&deg;C in the southern hemisphere for the early Eocene. Our polar circle to equatorial gradient is lower than most previous estimates at `r eocene_gradient_polar_circle$"50%"`&deg;C, although the 95% credible interval overlap with several of the listed gradient estimates. -->

<!-- OUTDATED Discrepancies between earlier, proxy-based reconstructions and our modelling results are most pronounced in latitudes beyond the polar circle, as earlier approaches [e.g. @Tierney2017] predict almost linearly decreasing SSTs towards the poles, whereas our median prediction suggests only a slight decrease beyond the polar circle. The scarcity of temperature records in this range leads to widening credible intervals in our prediction, including the possibility of stronger temperature decreases. Polar temperature estimates from our model are thus conservative in that they admit large uncertainty where data is absent, which is desirable. However, the presence of high proxy-derived temperature estimates at \~ 60&deg; latitudes forces the modelled median temperature curve to be too high at \~ 24&deg;C, relative to the temperatures indicated by the high-latitude mangrove communities (15.6 - 22.5&deg;C). In contrast, the extrapolated polar temperatures of most previous proxy-based models are likely too low, given the abundance of ecological data indicating temperate or subtropical high-latitude climates during the EECO [@Pross2012; @Popescu2021]. -->

The very high variability of the proxy record in mid-latitudes results in large uncertainties on the shape of temperature gradient and on the GMST. Some of this variability may stem from spatial variability in SSTs, as can be observed in the modern (Fig. 3), e.g. due to ocean circulation [@Rahmstorf2002]. Biases and errors in the proxy reconstructions also likely contribute to the observed variability, as geochemical proxies reflect many other factors besides seawater temperature [@Hollis2019]. Despite excluding &delta;^18^O measurements from recrystallised fossils, systematic offsets remain between mostly warm temperatures derived from TEX~86~, and cooler temperatures derived from &delta;^18^O, &Delta;~47~, and the ecological proxies. 

Temporal changes within the EECO [@Westerhold2018], and seasonality [@Keating-Bitonti2011; @Ivany2022] may also contribute to the large variability of the EECO proxy data. Based on the occurrence of heterotrophic carbonates, @Davies2019 suggest that mid- and high-latitude geochemical proxy data from the EECO may be biased towards summer temperatures. Some of the geochemical mid-latitude geochemical proxy data from @Hollis2019 may therefore suggest higher than actual mean annual temperatures, and the variability of temperature estimates from individual localities is higher in mid - high latitudes (Fig. S6). Critically, however, the mangrove data strongly supports our inference of a flattened gradient independent of the geochemical proxy record.

Recent, marine GMST estimates of the EECO and of the early Eocene range from 23.4--37.1&deg;C, with the lowest GMSTs being derived from &delta;^18^O, and the higher estimates including TEX~86~ [@Inglis2020]. Many studies include both marine and terrestrial proxies to derive GMST estimates, but despite great differences in proxy selection and in the calculation of global average temperatures, many recent estimates fall in the range of 27 - 29.5&deg;C [@Hansen2013; @Caballero2013; @Cramwinckel2018; @Zhu2019], similar to our median GMST estimate of `r eotemp_global$"50%"`&deg;C.

# Conclusions

The Bayesian hierarchical model presented here is able to reconstruct latitudinal gradients from both geochemical and ecological proxy data, while reflecting the uncertainty associated with the ecological temperature proxies, and accounting for the variation of multiple temperature estimates at individual localities. Using informative prior information allows for accurate temperature reconstructions from records with geographically incomplete sampling. By providing temperature estimates across the entire latitudinal range, this method also facilitates the reconstruction of unbiased global average temperatures. Application of our model to the EECO suggests that latitudinal sea surface temperature gradients were shallower than estimated by most previous proxy-based studies. High-latitude pollen records support this interpretation. Our GMST estimate is in good agreement with most existing estimates, indicating that broadly accurate GMST reconstructions are possible even with substantial deviations in the shape of the latitudinal temperature gradient. Our new method opens the door for improving the accuracy of proxy-based palaeoclimate reconstructions and Phanerozoic temperature curves, particularly in intervals with a patchy and unenvenly sampled record. Finally, the flexibility of our approach means that estimates can be efficiently updated when new data are made available.

<!-- for reconstructing past temperatures by incorporating both geochemical and ecological data. The use of a Bayesian framework allows for the specification of prior information based on physical constraints, which can improve interpolation and prediction. By modelling the temperature variation across latitudes, a complete temperature distribution is obtained, filling in gaps in the proxy record and reducing the risk of bias in global mean surface temperature (GMST) estimates. The hierarchical structure of the model accounts for the variation of temperature estimates at individual localities and uncertainty associated with the ecological temperature proxies. This improved method is expected to significantly alter the proxy-based temperature reconstructions of the past, particularly for intervals with small or biased samples of temperature proxies. -->
